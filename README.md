# Asuka 120% Limit Over Training
This is a Lua script for Asuka 120% Limit Over.

I took [VickGE's](https://github.com/VickGE/A120LO-LUA) code as a reference for writing this script.
The only new functionnality that I implemented is :
- Launching the script only when "Deku" is selected.

This script is meant to be used as an help for the training mode in Asuka 120% Limit Over.
As Vick said in his readme, this still needs work. 

For more information join the [Asuka 120% Discord server](https://discord.gg/dw5kXcZxTa).

## How to use
- Open BizHawk and load the game
- Drag "AsukaTraining.lua" into the BizHawk window
